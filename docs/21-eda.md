### What is EDA (Posit Primers: [Visualise Data](https://posit.cloud/learn/primers/3.1))

1. EDA is an iterative cycle that helps you understand what your data says. When you do EDA, you:

2. Generate questions about your data

3. Search for answers by visualising, transforming, and/or modeling your data

Use what you learn to refine your questions and/or generate new questions

EDA is an important part of any data analysis. You can use EDA to make discoveries about the world; or you can use EDA to ensure the quality of your data, asking questions about whether the data meets your standards or not.
