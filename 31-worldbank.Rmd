The term **Open Data** has a very precise meaning. Data or content is open if anyone is free to use, re-use or redistribute it, subject at most to measures that preserve provenance and openness.

1. The data must be _legally open_, which means they must be placed in the public domain or under liberal terms of use with minimal restrictions.
2. The data must be _technically open_, which means they must be published in electronic formats that are machine readable and non-proprietary, so that anyone can access and use the data using common, freely available software tools. Data must also be publicly available and accessible on a public server, without password or firewall restrictions. To make Open Data easier to find, most organizations create and manage Open Data catalogs.

## Function WDI

* **Usage**

```
WDI(country = "all",
    indicator = "NY.GDP.PCAP.KD",
    start = 1960,
    end = 2020,
    extra = FALSE,
    cache = NULL)
```

* **Arguments** See Help!
  - country: Vector of countries (ISO-2 character codes, e.g. "BR", "US", "CA", or "all") 
  - indicator: If you supply a named vector, the indicators will be automatically renamed: `c('women_private_sector' = 'BI.PWK.PRVS.FE.ZS')`



## Function WDIsearch

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(WDI)
```

```{r cache=TRUE}
WDIsearch(string = "NY.GDP.PCAP.KD", 
          field = "indicator", cache = NULL)
```



```{r cache=TRUE}
WDIsearch(string = "population", 
          field = "name", short=FALSE, cache = NULL)
```



```
WDIsearch(string = "NY.GDP.PCAP.KD", 
  field = "indicator", short = FALSE, cache = NULL)
```
```
WDIsearch(string = "gdp", 
  field = "name", short = TRUE, cache = NULL) 
```



## Bulk Downloads at WDI site

WDIbulk downloads the zip file of Bulk Downloads in [WDI site](https://datatopics.worldbank.org/world-development-indicators/) , it is a list containing 6 data frames: Data, Country, Series, Country-Series, Series-Time, FootNote.



## WDIcache

Download an updated list of available WDI indicators from the World Bank website. Returns a list for use in the WDIsearch function.

```{r widcache, eval=FALSE}
wdi_cache <- WDIcache()
```

Downloading all series information from the World Bank website can take time. The WDI package ships with a local data object with information on all the series available on 2012-06-18. You can update this database by retrieving a new list using `WDIcache`, and then feeding the resulting object to `WDIsearch` via the cache argument.

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
write_rds(wdi_cache, "./data/wdi_cache.RData", refhook = NULL)
```

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
wdi_cache <- read_rds("./data/wdi_cache.RData", refhook = NULL)
```





```{r}
glimpse(wdi_cache)
```




## WDI_data

List of 2 data frames

The first character matrix includes a full list of WDI series. This list is updated semi-regularly. Users can refresh the list manually using the 'WDIcache()' function and search in the updated list using the 'cache' argument.




```{r}
WDI_data$country  %>% filter(country == "Japan")
```



```{r}
WDIsearch(string = "gdp", 
  field = "name", short = FALSE, cache = wdi_cache) 
```
