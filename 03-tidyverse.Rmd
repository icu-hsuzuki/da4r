## Brief Introduction to R on RStudio - Review

### Create a New Project

After starting RStudio, create a new project using `New Project` under the top `File` menu. From next time, you can find your project from `Open Project` or `Recent Project` under the top `File` menu.

You can also start the project by clicking or opening the `project_name`.Rpoj file.

### Four Panes and Tabs

1. Top Left: Source Editor
2. Top Right: Environment, History, etc.
3. Bottom Left: Console, Terminal, Render, Background Jobs
4. Bottom Right: Files, Plots, Packages, Help, Viewer, Presentation



## Set up

* Highly recommend to set the language to be "English".
* Create "data" directory.

```{r warning=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
Sys.setenv(LANG = "en")
dir.create("./data")
```



## Three Ways to Run Codes

1. Console - Bottom Left Pane  
  - We have run codes on the console already!
2. R Script - pull-down menu under File
3. R Notebook, R Markdown - pull down menu under File



## R Script - Second Way to Run Codes

### Examples: R Scripts in Moodle

* `basics.R`
* `coronavirus.R`

1. Copy a script in Moodle: _{file name}.R_
2. In RStudio (create Project in RStudio) choose File > New File > R Script and paste it.
3. Choose File > Save As, save with a name; e.g. _{file names}_ (.R will be added automatically)

To run a code: at the cursor press *Ctrl+Shift+Enter* (Win) or *Cmd+Shift+Enter* (Mac). 


* Top Manu: Help > Keyboard Short Cut Help contains many shortcuts.
* Bottom Right Pane: Check the files by selecting the `Files` tab.



## Packages

R packages are extensions to the R statistical programming language. R packages contain code, data, and documentation in a standardised collection format that can be installed by users of R, typically via a centralised software repository such as CRAN (the Comprehensive R Archive Network).

### Installation and attachement

You can install packages by "Install Packages..." under "Tool" in the top menu.
It is also possible to install packages by running the following codes in the console.

* `install.packages("tidyverse")`
* `install.packages("rmarkdown")`



## R Notebook - Third Way to Run Codes

Choose R Notebook from the pull down File menu in the top bar.

### Edit YAML

**Default is as follows**

```

title: "R Notebook"
output: html_notebook

```



**Template**

```

title: "Title of R Notebook"
author: "ID and Your Name"
date: "`r Sys.Date()`" 
output: 
  html_notebook:
#    number_sections: yes
#    toc: true
#    toc_float: true

```

* Don't change the format. Indention matters.
* The statement after \# is ignored.
* Date is automatically inserted when you compile the file.
* You can replace "`r Sys.Date()`" by "2022-12-14" or in any date format surrounded by double quotation marks.
* Section numbers: - default is `number_sections: no`.
* Table of contents, `toc: true` - default is `toc: false`.
* Floating table of contents in HTML output, `toc_float: true` - default is `toc_float: false`



### Create a Code Chunk to Attach Packages

Insert Chunk in Code pull down menu in the top bar, or use the <kbd>C</kbd> button on top. You can use shortcut keys listed under Tools in the top bar.

We have installed the package `tidyverse`. However, in order to use it, we need to attach, or load, by calling `library(tidyverse)`.

You can run the code in a code chunk by clicking the triangle mark at the top right corner. 

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```


## First Example

### Importing data

Let us assign the `iris` data in the pre-installed package `datasets` to `df_iris`. You can give any name starting from an alphabet, though there are some rules. 

```{r}
df_iris <- datasets::iris
class(df_iris)
```

The class of data `iris` is `data.frame`, the basic data class of R. You can assign the same data as a `tibble`, the data class of `tidyverse` as follows.

```{r}
tbl_iris <- as_tibble(datasets::iris)
class(tbl_iris)
```

* `df_iris <- iris` can replace  `df_iris <- datasets::iris` because the package `datasets` is installed and attached as default. Since you may have other data called `iris` included in a different package or you may have changed `iris` before, it is safer to specify the package's name with the data's name.
* Within R Notebook or in Console, you may get different output, and `tf_iris` and `tbl_iris` behave differently. It is because of the default settings of R Markdown. 



### Look at the data

#### Several ways to view the data.

The `View` command opens up a window to show the contents of the data, and you can also use the filter.

```{r viewiris, eval = FALSE}
View(df_iris)
```


The following simple command also shows the data. 

```{r dfiris, eval=FALSE}
df_iris
```
```{r echo=FALSE, eval=TRUE}
df_iris %>% slice(1:10)
```

`%>%` is called a pipe command, and we use it often. 

The output within R Notebook is a tibble style. Try the same command in Console.

```{r slice10iris}
slice(df_iris, 1:10)
```

```{r one2ten}
1:10
```




#### Data Structure

Let us look at the structure of the data. You can try `str(df_iris)` on Console or by adding a code chunk in R Notebook introducing later.

```{r glimpse:eiris}
glimpse(df_iris)
```

There are six types of data in R; Double, Integer, Character, Logical, Raw, and Complex. In this course, we use only the first four.

The names after $ are column names. If you call `df_iris$Species`, you have the Species column. Species is in the 5th column, `typeof(df_iris[[5]])` does the same as the next. 

`df_iris[2,4] = ``r df_iris[2,4]` is the fourth entry of Sepal.Width.



```{r}
typeof(df_iris$Species)
```

```{r}
class(df_iris$Species)
```

For `factors = fct` see [the R Document](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/base/versions/3.6.2/topics/factor) or an explanation in [Factor in R: Categorical Variable & Continuous Variables](https://www.guru99.com/r-factor-categorical-continuous.html).



```{r}
typeof(df_iris$Sepal.Length)
class(df_iris$Sepal.Length)
```


**Q1.** What are the differences of `df_iris`, `slice(df_iris, 1:10)` and `glimpse(df_iris)` above?

**Q2.** What are the differences of`df_iris`, `slice(df_iris, 1:10)` and `glimpse(df_iris)` in the console?



#### Summary of the Data

The following is very convenient to get the summary information of a data.

```{r}
summary(df_iris)
```

Minimum, 1st Quadrant (25%),  Median, Mean, 3rd Quadrant (75%), Maximum, and the count of each factor.



### Visualizing Data

#### Scatter Plot

We use `ggplot` to draw graphs. The scatter plot is a projection of data with two variables $x$ and $y$. 

```
ggplot(data = <data>, aes(x = <column name for x>, y = <column name for y>)) +
  geom_point()
```
```
ggplot(data = df_iris, aes(x = Sepal.Length, y = Sepal.Width)) +
  geom_point()
```




```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, comment=FALSE}
ggplot(data = df_iris, aes(x = Sepal.Length, y = Sepal.Width)) +
  geom_point()
```



#### Scatter Plot with [Labels](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/labs.html)

Add title and labels adding `labs()`. 

```
ggplot(data = <data>, aes(x = <column name for x>, y = <column name for y>)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(title = "Title", x = "Label for x", y = "Label for y")
```


```{r}
ggplot(data = df_iris, aes(x = Sepal.Length, y = Sepal.Width)) +
  geom_point() + 
  labs(title = "Scatter Plot of Sepal Data of Iris", x = "Sepal Length", y = "Sepal Width")
```



#### Scatter Plot with [Colors](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/aes_colour_fill_alpha.html)

Add different colors automatically to each species. Can you see each group?

```{r}
ggplot(data = df_iris, aes(x = Sepal.Length, y = Sepal.Width, color = Species)) +
  geom_point()
```



#### Scatter Plot with Shapes

```{r}
ggplot(data = df_iris, aes(x = Sepal.Length, y = Sepal.Width, shape = Species)) +
  geom_point()
```



#### [Boxplot](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/geom_boxplot.html)

The boxplot compactly displays the distribution of a continuous variable. 

```{r}
ggplot(data = df_iris, aes(x = Species, y = Sepal.Length)) +
  geom_boxplot()
```



#### [Histogram](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/geom_histogram.html)

Visualize the distribution of a single continuous variable by dividing the x axis into bins and counting the number of observations in each bin. Histograms (geom_histogram()) display the counts with bars. 

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
ggplot(data = df_iris, aes(x = Sepal.Length)) +
  geom_histogram()
```



Change the number of bins by `bins =` `<number>`.

```{r}
ggplot(data = df_iris, aes(x = Sepal.Length)) +
  geom_histogram(bins = 10)
```



### Data Modeling 

Professor Kaizoji will cover the mathematical models and hypothesis testings. 

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
ggplot(data = df_iris, aes(x = Sepal.Length, y = Sepal.Width)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE)
```
